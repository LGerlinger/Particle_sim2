# Particle simulator 2

This program is a collision-based particle simulator.  
Don't get too hopeful, "particle" is a just a fancy way to say disc.

Anyway, I have done another particle simulator 2 years ago.
But with time I realised I may have done some mistakes back then and intend to correct them.  
So this is kind of a revenge on this previous project and I hope to make a truly improved version with what I have learned. This should include :
- Better file organisation
- Multi-threading of the simulation
- A thread for displaying and event handling
- Use of shaders
- Not being a mess (no garantee)

## This program uses SFML

The c++ program uses SFML. I think I used [this guide](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-linux.php) for the installation.
